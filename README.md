# AETHERIA_SPACE_SIMULATION
# 🌌 AETHERIA: Space Simulation Engine

AETHERIA is a high-performance, browser-based cosmic simulation engine built with **Three.js**.  
It visualizes large-scale astrophysical and abstract phenomena using real-time particle systems, cinematic camera motion, and AI-assisted narration.

This project is designed as a **sandbox visualization engine**, blending science, mathematics, and digital art.
